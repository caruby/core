UOM implements Units of Measurement based on the
<a href=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/sp330.pdf>International System of Units (SI)</a>.
The base SI units, metric scalar factors and all possible combinations of these units are supported out of the box.

Common alternative non-metric measurement systems, e.g. US Customary units, are supported with conversions between
these units and the SI units. Additional units can be defined with conversion to an existing unit. UOM infers
full conversion capability between units of the same dimension from the minimal number of conversion definitions.

Arithmetic operations between UOM Measurement objects converts the measurement units and scalar factors as necessary,
including unit products, quotients and powers of arbitrary complexity.
