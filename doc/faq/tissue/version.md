Executing any caRuby Tissue command with the option `--version` prints the current caRuby Tissue version as well as the supported caTissue version, e.g.:

    $ crtsmoke --version
    1.2.1 for caTissue v1.1.2

caTissue releases prior to 1.1.2 are not supported by caRuby. Note that caRuby follows the [RubyGems Versioning Policy](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/7) and does *not* necessarily have the same version number as its supported caTissue version.
